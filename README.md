# Property Rental Platform

## Overview

This project is a property rental platform built using React. It features property listings, a booking management system, and a checkout process. The application is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

1. **Property Listings**
   - Display a variety of properties with images, titles, descriptions, prices, and "Book Now" buttons.
   - Implement filters to allow users to sort properties by location, price range, number of bedrooms, or amenities.

2. **Booking Management**
   - A booking management system to allow users to book properties.
   - A cart section to manage booked properties, showing property details, booking dates, and total cost.
   - Allow users to increase, decrease, or remove booked properties from the cart.
   - Real-time updates of the cart total and booking count.

3. **Checkout Process**
   - Calculate the total cost of booked properties.
   - Allow users to enter booking details, including contact information and payment details.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the website is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Optimize the layout for different screen sizes to provide an optimal viewing experience.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Create a new React application using Create React App.
   - Set up the folder structure to organize components, assets, data, and Redux-related files.

2. **Components**
   - Develop reusable components for Property Listings, Filters, Cart, Checkout, and Header.
   - Use React hooks for managing state and side effects within functional components.

3. **State Management**
   - Implement Redux for state management to handle global state like the cart.
   - Create actions and reducers for managing cart actions (add, remove, update).

4. **Routing**
   - Use React Router for client-side routing to handle navigation between different pages (Home, Cart, Checkout).
   - Update to React Router v6, replacing `Switch` with `Routes` and `Route`.

5. **Styling**
   - Use CSS for styling components, ensuring a responsive design.
   - Organize styles in a separate folder under `assets`.

6. **Data Handling**
   - Store property data in a JSON file and fetch it in the PropertyListing component.
   - Filter properties based on user input for location, price range, and number of bedrooms.

7. **Booking and Checkout**
   - Implement a booking system where users can add properties to the cart.
   - Display the cart with options to update or remove items.
   - Implement a simple checkout form to capture user details and calculate the total cost.

# Usage
Home Page: Displays the list of properties with filters.
Cart: View and manage booked properties.
Checkout: Enter booking details and complete the booking process.


# Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Redux, React Router
Styling: CSS
Data Handling: JSON for static data
Build Tool: Create React App

# Additional Notes
Ensure you are using the latest version of react-router-dom to avoid issues with routing components.
The application uses a simple JSON file for property data. In a real-world scenario, this data would typically come from a backend API.
Redux is used for state management to handle the cart state, making it easier to manage and scale the application.
The project is designed to be easily extendable with more features such as user authentication, payment integration, and more complex filtering options.
